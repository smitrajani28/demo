                C is a procedural programming language.
                It was initially developed by Dennis 
                Ritchie as a system programming 
                language to write operating system. 
                The main features of C language include
                low-level access to memory, simple set 
                of keywords, and clean style, these 
                features make C language suitable for
                system programming like operating system 
                or compiler development.
