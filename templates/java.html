            Java has been one of the most 
            popular programming language 
            for many years. Java is Object 
            Oriented. However it is not 
            considered as pure object oriented
            as it provides support for primitive
            data types (like int, char, etc) The
            Java codes are first compiled into byte
            code (machine independent code). Then
            the byte code is run on Java Virtual
            Machine (JVM) regardless of the
            underlying architecture.
